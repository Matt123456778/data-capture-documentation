## 6.24.0

**Released**: May 8, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

- **Smart Scan Intention**: Introduced a new algorithm that intelligently identifies and scans the intended barcode, reducing errors. Enabled by default in SparkScan (`SparkScanSettings.scanIntention`) and can be manually set in Barcode Capture (`BarcodeCaptureSettings.scanIntention`).
  
- **Improved Scanning Range**: Enhanced the scanning range for 1D barcodes on Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) and paper shelf labels by 30-40% in both Full HD and 4K, without compromising scanning speed. This improvement benefits scanning tiny barcodes and ESLs, especially those on top or bottom shelves.

- **User-Facing Camera**: SparkScan now allows switching to the user-facing camera for scanning. Useful in scenarios where the rear camera is not accessible or barcodes are hard to reach. See `SparkScanView.cameraSwitchButtonVisible`.

- **Dynamic Item List in MatrixScan Find**: Added support for dynamically modifying the list of items to be found by calling `BarcodeFind.setItemList()` during a scanning session.

- **New Symbology Supports**:
  - **Symbology.FRENCHPOST**: Recognizes postal codes used by the French Post.
  - **Symbology.AUSTRALIANPOST**: Decodes misprinted Australian Post codes.

- **BarcodePick View Highlight Styles**: Added new APIs to show different highlights while waiting for an async pick/unpick action. Setters & getters for selected brushes and/or icons are in `Rectangular`, `Dot`, `RectangularWithIcons`, and `DotWithIcons`. Asynchronous selection is available with the new `BarcodePickViewHighlightStyleResponse` constructor.

- **Programmatic Item Selection**: Added `BarcodePick.selectItemWithData()` to programmatically select an item.

- **Progress Bar in BarcodeCountView**: Added `BarcodeCountView.shouldShowListProgressBar` to enable showing/hiding the progress bar when a capture list is set.

#### ID

- **Reject Voided IDs**: Added `IdCaptureSettings.rejectVoidedIds` to reject documents voided by authorities. Supports cut corners, holes punched in the document, and “VOID” perforations. Currently supports only US Driver’s Licenses. Requires the `ScanditIdVoidedDetection` library.
  
- **Rejection Reason**: Added `RejectedId.rejectionReason` to provide the reason for document rejection.

- **State-Specific Thresholds in ID Verification**: Added support for per-state thresholds and removed the hardcoded number of features. This is a breaking change; old verification models will not work.

- **Timeout Callback Modification**: Modified `IdCaptureListener.onIdCaptureTimedOut()` to be invoked when a document is localized for a period but not captured.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Added `AamvaBarcodeResult.rawData`.
  - Fixed truncated surnames in US driver’s licenses using magnetic stripe format.

- **Newly Supported Documents**:
  - **MRZ Scanning**: Mexico: Matrícula Consular
  - **Front of Card/VIZ Scanning**:
    - USA: District of Columbia, Idaho, North Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin (2023 versions)
    - Mexico: Consular Voter ID
  - Added `CapturedId.secondaryLastName` containing the common name (“nom d’usage”) on French passports.

#### Parser

- **GS1 Digital Link**: Expanded support to include uncompressed GS1 Digital Link. For complete documentation, refer to the official website.

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

- **Battery Saving Mode**: Changed from `BatterySavingMode.OFF` to `BatterySavingMode.AUTO`. This can be changed via `SparkScanSettings.batterySaving`.

### Performance Improvements

#### ID

- Improved capture performance for US driver’s license PDF417 barcodes with printing defects, particularly from Ohio, Louisiana, and Florida.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

- Fixed the “Tap to Focus” animation when the view size changes.

#### ID

- Fixed a crash when scanning a passport MRZ followed by a non-passport VIZ.
- Fixed incorrect date handling for European IDs, Swiss driver’s licenses, and UAE IDs.
- Fixed incorrect information extraction from British Columbia PDF417.

### API Changes

#### Barcode

- **Renamed Methods in BarcodePickView**:
  - **Lifecycle Methods**:
    - `Activity/Fragment onResume` should call `BarcodePickView.onResume()`.
    - `Activity/Fragment onPause` should call `BarcodePickView.onPause()`.
    - `Activity onDestroy` or `Fragment onDestroyView` should call `BarcodePickView.onDestroy()`.
  - **Start/Stop Scanning**:
    - `BarcodePickView.start()` starts the scanning flow and can be manually stopped by calling `BarcodePickView.stop()`. It will be stopped automatically when `BarcodePickView.onPause()` is called and resumed with `BarcodePickView.onResume()`.
    - `BarcodePickView.stop()` stops the scanning flow and can be manually started with `BarcodePickView.start()`.
  
:::note
Scanning is only possible when in resumed state. `BarcodePickView.start()` will not start scanning if `BarcodePickView.onResume()` is not called before or after.
:::

## 6.23.2

**Released**: April 30, 2024

* Fixed crash (SIGILL) on Exynos 9810-based Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ devices that advertise support for FP16 arithmetics. A previous fix in 6.21.0 only partially resolved the issue.

* Added support for Mexican Matrícula Consular MRZ codes.
* Improved ID scanning performance in low-light conditions.
* Fixed truncated surnames in US driver’s licenses using magnetic stripe format.

## 6.23.0

**Released**: March 22, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

SparkScan has received a number of updates and improvements:

- The target mode has been improved with better performances (faster selection of barcodes), a more consistent workflow (the target mode will only show the aimer, without changing the preview size or the way barcodes are scanned), and a better UI (new aimer and new icon).
- The preview size is now independent from scanning mode or scanning precision (deprecated) parameters. Instead, it is controlled by a dedicated control added to the preview. Use `SparkScanView.previewSizeControlVisible` to define if the preview size control should be displayed.
- The "accuracy" workflow has been revisited and streamlined into a more consistent and performant workflow.
- Developers can set `SparkScanPreviewBehavior` to specify the preview behavior type of the `SparkScanView`. When `previewBehavior` is `SparkScanPreviewBehavior.PERSISTENT`, after the scan the preview does not disappear, but stays obscured and running (but not scanning) for easier aiming.
- Added `Target.previewBehavior` and `Default.previewBehavior` to specify preview behavior for scanning modes.
- Added initializers for Target and Default that accept `SparkScanPreviewBehavior` instead of `SparkScanScanningPrecision`.
- Toast messages are now displayed on top of the preview rather than the scan button. Additional toast messages have been added for better guidance.
- Added `barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanToastSettings.TorchEnabledMessage` and `barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanToastSettings.TorchDisabledMessage` to specify toast messages when the torch is enabled or disabled.
- The zoom functionality is now independent of scanning mode and is available in both default and target modes.
- Added `SparkScanViewSettings.zoomFactorOut` and `SparkScanViewSettings.zoomFactorIn` to specify the default zoom factor in zoomed out and zoomed in states for both scanning modes, default and target.
- The feedback emission system has been improved: for new implementation, there is no need to explicitly emit a success feedback on scan, as it became implicit.
- Added `SparkScanBarcodeFeedback`, `SparkScanFeedbackDelegate`, and `SparkScanView.feedbackDelegate` to define and emit feedback that can be customized for every scanned barcode.
- Added `SparkScanViewSettings.inactiveStateTimeout` to specify the timeout to automatically stop scanning across all modes.
- Barcode Pick is an API that implements MatrixScan Pick. MatrixScan Pick is an out-of-the-box scan solution; it uses real-time inventory data and augmented reality to assign precise, item-specific tasks, guaranteeing pinpoint accuracy in restocking, inventory audits, and parcel delivery. Barcode Pick is no longer in beta and a new feature has been added in 6.23:
  - Added `BarcodePickStatusIconStyle` to display additional information on top of the regular highlight.
  - Added `BarcodePickViewHighlightStyle` to visualize a custom view on top of the tracked barcodes.
  - Added `BarcodePickListener` to listen to `BarcodePickSession` to know the items currently on screen and the newly added items.
- Added support for `Symbology.AUSTRALIANPOST`. By default, customer information is decoded with Table N, and Table C is used as a fallback. To set a specific decoding table for the customer information, use the symbology extensions: `force_table_c` or `force_table_n` to enforce decoding with either C or N tables respectively. The symbology extension `decode_bar_states` returns the error-corrected customer information bars as a string of the bar states: A for ascending, D for descending, T for tracker, and F for full.
- Added getter and setter methods for hints shown when a barcode not in the expected list is scanned in `BarcodeCountView` (see `BarcodeCountView.getTextForBarcodesNotInListDetectedHint()` and `BarcodeCountView.setTextForBarcodesNotInListDetectedHint()`).

### Performance Improvements

#### Barcode

- Improved tracking robustness for low-end devices in MatrixScan Count.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

- Fixed the placement of `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay` for right-to-left layout direction.
- Fixed flickering of guidances in `BarcodeSelection`.

#### ID

- Fixed a crash that happened when scanning an Argentina ID document that contained non-UTF-8 characters in the barcode.
- Fixed issues with scanning AAMVA documents (barcode part) that contain characters from non-English alphabets.
- Fixed a licensing issue where a Barcode Scanner license was wrongly required when scanning the back side of a UK driver’s license.
- Fixed a crash when scanning a passport MRZ then a non-passport VIZ.

#### Core

- Fixed the radius of the radius location selection for cases where the `DataCaptureView`'s aspect ratio is considerably different from the aspect ratio of the camera frames.

#### Label

- Fixed the placement of `LabelCaptureAdvancedOverlay` for right-to-left layout direction.

### Deprecations

#### Barcode

SparkScan received a number of updates and improvements:

- New APIs have been added to SparkScan to deliver a number of updates and improvements. At the same time, some of the existing APIs have become irrelevant.
- Deprecated `SparkScanScanningPrecision`. Replaced by `SparkScanPreviewBehavior` because the "accurate" workflow has been simplified.
- Deprecated Target and Default initializers that accepted `SparkScanScanningPrecision`. Replaced by initializers that accept `SparkScanPreviewBehavior` instead.
- Deprecated `Target.scanningPrecision` and `Default.scanningPrecision`. Replaced with `Target.previewBehavior` and `Default.previewBehavior` to specify preview behavior for scanning modes.
- Deprecated `SparkScanView.shouldShowTargetModeHint` and `SparkScanView.targetModeHintText`. This hint is not displayed anymore due to changes in Target scanning mode.
- Deprecated `barcode.spark.ui.SparkScanToastSettings.CameraTimeoutMessage` because a toast with this message is not displayed anymore due to changes in the SparkScan toast system.
- Deprecated `SparkScanViewSettings.targetZoomFactorOut` and `SparkScanViewSettings.targetZoomFactorIn`. Replaced by `SparkScanViewSettings.zoomFactorOut` and `SparkScanViewSettings.zoomFactorIn`.
- Deprecated `SparkScanViewSettings.continuousCaptureTimeout`. Replaced by `SparkScanViewSettings.inactiveStateTimeout`.
- Deprecated `SparkScanViewFeedback`, `SparkScanFeedback`, `SparkScanView.brush`, and `SparkScanView.emitFeedback()`. These classes and methods are not used anymore. Use `SparkScanBarcodeFeedback` and `SparkScanView.feedbackDelegate`.

## 6.22.1

**Released**: March 13, 2024

* Improved ID scanning performance in low-light conditions.
* Fixed a licensing issue where a Barcode Scanner license was wrongly required when scanning the back side of a UK driver’s license.

## 6.22.0

**Released**: February 16, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

- The Parser has been expanded to support the IATA bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP). `ParserDataFormat.IATA_BCBP` supports the latest specifications from the 2023-2024 Passenger Services Conference Resolution Manual (PSCRM). For the complete documentation of the standard, please refer to the official website.
- SparkScan has been updated with some UI improvements:
  - The minimized trigger button has been redesigned to occupy less space when the scanner is stopped.
  - The expanded trigger button has been slightly decreased in size, to leave more space for the underlying application.
  - The setting toolbar shows by default fewer options (Target Mode and Torch), to offer a less crowded and more efficient user experience. The visibility of all the icons can still be personalized in the `SparkScanView`.
- Added `BarcodeGenerator.upcaBarcodeGeneratorBuilder()` to generate UPCA barcodes.
- Added QR symbology extension called `strict` to suppress rare QR reader false positives. `strict` reduces the scan robustness of damaged codes.
- Introduced smart battery management to lower the energy consumption and increase the up-time of the device. In our tests (repeatedly scanning a sequence of 5 different labels mimicking the user movement), this led to an improvement of up to 15% in battery life. This option is disabled by default, but it can be enabled via `BarcodeCaptureSettings.batterySavingMode`, deciding whether it’s automatic, always on, or always off (default).

#### ID

- Added `AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonResult.frontMismatchImage` that visualizes the document data printed on the front side that differs from what is encoded in the barcode. Please contact [Scandit Support](mailto:support@scandit.com) if you want to use this feature.
- Improved the accuracy of `AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonVerifier`.
- Improved the accuracy of `VizMrzComparisonVerifier`.
- Added `IdCaptureOverlay.textHintPosition` that allows setting of the textual hint position.
- Added `IdCaptureOverlay.showTextHints` for showing/hiding text hints.
- Replay the flip document animation when the user keeps scanning the wrong side of the document.
- Added `AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonResult.frontMismatchImage` that highlights suspicious fields. This feature is currently in beta and may change significantly in future releases.

### Behavioral Changes

#### Core

- Removed OkHttp dependency for API requests in favor of the Scandit internal client.

### Performance Improvements

#### Barcode

- Further improved QR code scan performance of codes occluded by glare.
- Improved scan performance for 1D barcodes with missing or damaged quiet zones.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

- Fixed layout of `BarcodeCountView` for devices with short screens.
- Fixed incorrect EAN13/UPCA checksum computation when generating barcodes with `BarcodeGenerator`.
- Fixed a bug in handling of active symbol counts for Codabar.

#### ID

- Fixed an issue where US Border Crossing Cards were not recognized.
- Latin name from the back side is now returned when scanning Oman IDs in `SupportedSides.FRONT_AND_BACK`.

### Deprecations

#### Barcode

- Deprecated `SparkScanViewSettings.ignoreDragLimits`. There is no drag limit anymore. The button can be repositioned all the way from the bottom to the top of the screen.

## 6.21.2

**Released**: January 19, 2024

* Latin name from the back side is now returned when scanning Oman IDs in SupportedSides.FRONT_AND_BACK.

### New Features

#### Barcode

SparkScan has been expanded with a range of new features and improvements:

- Introduced a smart battery management to lower the energy consumption and increase the up-time of the device. In our tests (repeatedly scanning a sequence of 5 different labels mimicking the user movement), this led to an improvement of up to 15% in battery life. This option is enabled by default, but it is possible to control it via battery saving mode, deciding whether it’s automatic (default), always on, or always off.
- Added `SparkScanViewUiListener.onScanningModeChange()` and `SparkScanView.getScanningMode()` for getting information when the `SparkScanScanningMode` changes and to get the currently used `SparkScanScanningMode`. This is useful, for example, to apply different settings when the Target Mode (or the Continuous Mode) is enabled/disabled.
- Added a gesture to collapse the trigger button with a swipe from the setting toolbar to the edge of the screen.
- The setting toolbar icons have been slightly redesigned and grouped in categories.
- Added contextual messages within the trigger button, called toasts, to guide the user while interacting with the UI. SparkScan offers a series of built-in messages, but custom messages can be shown by using the method `SparkScanView.showToast()`. For more information, check `SparkScanToastSettings`.
- Added support for `Symbology.UPU4STATE`.

#### ID

- `AamvaBarcodeVerifier` now performs document verification entirely on-device. However, to use it, an additional artifact is now required. Check documentation for details.
- For ID cards issued by the United Arab Emirates, data parsed from the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) is now returned automatically when `IdDocumentType.ID_CARD_VIZ` and `SupportedSides.FRONT_AND_BACK` are selected.

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

- Changed the default value of `SparkScanToastSettings.toastEnabled` to true.
