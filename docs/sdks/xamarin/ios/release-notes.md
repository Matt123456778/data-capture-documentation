## 6.24.0

**Released**: May 8, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

- **Smart Scan Intention**: Introduced a new algorithm that intelligently identifies and scans the intended barcode, reducing errors. Enabled by default in SparkScan (`SparkScanSettings.ScanIntention`) and can be manually set in Barcode Capture (`BarcodeCaptureSettings.ScanIntention`).

- **Improved Scanning Range**: Enhanced scanning range for 1D barcodes on Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) and paper shelf labels by 30-40% in both Full HD and 4K without compromising scanning speed. This improvement benefits scanning tiny barcodes and ESLs, especially those on top or bottom shelves.

- **User-Facing Camera**: SparkScan now allows switching to the user-facing camera for scanning, useful in scenarios where the rear camera is not accessible or barcodes are hard to reach. See `SparkScanView.CameraSwitchButtonVisible`.

- **New Symbology Support**:
  - **Symbology.AustralianPost**: Added support for decoding misprinted Australian Post codes.

#### ID

- **State-Specific Thresholds in ID Verification**: Added support for per-state thresholds and removed the hardcoded number of features. This is a breaking change; old verification models will not work.

- **Timeout Callback Modification**: Modified `IIdCaptureListener.OnIdCaptureTimedOut()` to be invoked whenever a document is localized for a period but not captured.

- **Fixed Surnames in US Driver’s Licenses**: Fixed truncated surnames in US driver’s licenses using magnetic stripe format.

- **Newly Supported Documents for MRZ Scanning**:
  - Mexico: Matrícula Consular

- **Newly Supported Documents for Front of Card/VIZ Scanning**:
  - USA:
    - District of Columbia - Driver License & ID Card (2023 version)
    - Idaho - Driver License & ID Card (2023 version)
    - North Dakota - Driver License & ID Card (2023 version)
    - West Virginia - Driver License & ID Card (2023 version)
    - Wisconsin - Driver License & ID Card (2023 version)
  - Mexico: Consular Voter ID

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

- **Battery Saving Mode**: Changed from `BatterySavingMode.Off` to `BatterySavingMode.Auto`. This can be changed via `SparkScanSettings.BatterySaving`.

### Performance Improvements

#### ID

- **Improved Capture Performance**: Enhanced capture performance for US driver’s license PDF417 barcodes with printing defects, particularly from Ohio, Louisiana, and Florida.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

- Fixed the “Tap to Focus” animation when the view size changes.

#### ID

- Fixed a crash when scanning a passport MRZ followed by a non-passport VIZ.
- Fixed an issue causing the century of birth dates, issue dates, and expiry dates to be returned incorrectly when scanning the VIZ of European IDs, Swiss driver’s licenses, and UAE IDs.
- Fixed instances where information was incorrectly extracted from British Columbia PDF417.
