# About MatrixScan

MatrixScan enables you to build applications and workflows involving highlighting and/or interacting with multiple barcodes within the same frame. It can be used to build augmented-reality (AR) experiences by adding overlays to the application UI.

MatrixScan is powered by the [`SDCBarcodeTracking`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/ios/barcode-capture/api/barcode-tracking.html#class-scandit.datacapture.barcode.tracking.BarcodeTracking) functionality of the Scandit Smart Data Capture SDK.

## Limitations

MatrixScan does not support the following symbologies:

* DotCode
* MaxiCode
* All postal codes (KIX, RM4SCC)
