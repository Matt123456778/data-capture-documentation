## IdBoltSession

The main class of ID Bolt. It represents a session in which the end-user is guided through a workflow to scan their ID. The `IdBoltSession.onCompletion()` callback is called when the user has scanned their ID, the ID has been accepted and the ID Bolt pop-up is closed. Similarly, `IdBoltSession.onCancellation()` is called when the user closes the ID Bolt pop-up without finishing the full process successfully.

Using validators, ID Bolt can verify the expiration date or other features of the ID. Optionally, this can be done without sharing any personally identifiable information (PII) with your website.

### Methods

#### `create`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `static create(serviceUrl: string, options: IdBoltCreateSessionOptions): IdBoltSession` | Primary way to create an ID Bolt session. |

##### Parameters

- `serviceUrl: string`: URL that ID Bolt loads when started. Provided in your account on the [Scandit dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard).

:::note
The default value `app.id-scanning.com` is an alias that points to Scandit’s servers. In a production environment it can be changed to your own domain name pointing to Scandit’s servers. This will require you to configure a CNAME record in the DNS settings of your domain.
:::

- `options: IdBoltCreateSessionOptions`: Object specifying the session options:
  - `licenseKey: string`: Your license key, provided in you account on the [Scandit dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard).
  - `documentSelection: DocumentSelection`: Object specifying the acceptable documents. See *[`DocumentSelection`](#documentselection)*.
  - `returnDataMode: ReturnDataMode`: Defines the extent of the data returned by the `onCompletion()` callback. Use:    
    - `RETURN_DATA_MODE.FULL_WITH_IMAGES` to get all extracted data and images.
    - `RETURN_DATA_MODE.FULL` to get all extracted data without images.
    - `RETURN_DATA_MODE.ONLY_VALIDATION_RESULTS` to only get the result of the validators.
  - `validation?: Validators[]`: Optional array of validators, default: `[]`. See *[`Validators`](#validators)*. 
  - `locale?: string`: the language in which the text is displayed. Currently only english (`"en"`) is supported. Default: `"en"`.

Once created, a session object does nothing until you execute `start()` on it:

```ts
const idBoltSession = IdBoltSession.create(ID_BOLT_URL, {
	licenseKey: LICENSE_KEY,
	documentSelection,
	returnDataMode: RETURN_DATA_MODE.FULL_WITH_IMAGES,
	validation: [Validators.notExpired()],
});
await idBoltSession.start();
```

#### `onCompletion`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `IdBoltSession.onCompletion: (result: CompletionResult) => void` | A callback that is called when the user has successfully scanned their ID. Depending on the `RETURN_DATA_MODE` value you passed in `IdBoltSession`, `result.capturedId` will contain the document data or `null`. |

#### `onCancellation`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `IdBoltSession.onCancellation: () => void` | A callback that is called when the user has closed the ID Bolt pop-up without having finished the scanning workflow. |

#### `start`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `async IdBoltSession.start(): Promise<string>` | Open the ID Bolt pop-up to start the scanning workflow. This method returns a session ID identifying the session. |

## DocumentSelection

A class to define which types of documents the ID Bolt will accept. The list of documents is provided as couples of `Region` and `DocumentType`, for example passports from the USA.

Documents that are not acceptable may still get recognized by the scanner. In this case the user will be notified to use one of the accepted document types.

### Methods

#### `create`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `static DocumentSelection.create(selection: Selection): DocumentSelection` | Primary way to create a `DocumentSelection` instance with all the included and excluded documents. Only `Selection.include` is mandatory. |

```ts
const documentSelection = DocumentSelection.create({
	include: [
		[Region.USA, DocumentType.Passport],
		// you can pass more than one document type
		[Region.FRA, DocumentType.Passport, DocumentType.IdCard],
	],
	exclude: [[Region.CHE, DocumentType.DriverLicense]],
});
```

If you have very specific rules, you can use the `Selection.customCallback` option where you can decide if the scanned document should be accepted or not:

```ts
const documentSelection = DocumentSelection.create({
	include: [[Region.USA, DocumentType.Passport]],
	customCallback: (capturedId: CapturedId, preCheckResults: PreCheckResults) => {
		if (capturedId.documentNumber === "123") {
			return {
				valid: false,
				// this message will be displayed to the user
				message: `Documents starting with "123" are not accepted.`,
			};
		}
		// when not returning anything, the default behavior will take place
	},
});
```

## Validators

Validators enable you to run checks on the scanned ID. They are only run on accepted documents.

### Methods

#### `notExpired`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Validators.notExpired()` | Checks that the document has not expired. Note that this test will not pass if the expiration date could not be determined from the extracted data.|


#### `notExpiredIn`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Validators.notExpiredIn(duration: Duration)` | Checks that the document has still not expired after the duration passed in argument. This test will not pass if the expiration date could not be determined from the extracted data.|
| | `Duration` is an object with following properties: `days?: number`, `months?: number`. |


In the following example, the ID must not expire in the next 12 months:

```ts
const idBoltSession = IdBoltSession.create(ID_BOLT_URL, {
	licenseKey: LICENSE_KEY,
	documentSelection: ...,
	returnDataMode: RETURN_DATA_MODE.FULL_WITH_IMAGES,
	validation: [Validators.notExpiredIn({months: 12})],
});
```

#### `holderAgeAtLeast`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Validators.holderAgeAtLeast(age: number)` | Checks that the holder of the ID has at least the age specified in argument. Note that this test will not pass if the age of the ID holder could not be determined from the extracted data.|


#### `US.isRealID`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Validators.US.isRealID()` | Checks that the scanned driver license is compliant with the rules of Real ID defined by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). Note that this test will not pass if the scanned document is not an AAMVA document.|
